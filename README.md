- 👋  Hi, I’m Tania
- ✨  I’m interested in living life like a G.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning coding, mastering the full art of riding a motorcycle and how to stay positive in hard situations
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on growing my brand and making a page for my video editing projects. Maybe open a PI business one day (It's easier said than done) 
- 📫  How to reach me ttorresbiz@gmail.com.
